Best with: Agentic AI (LangGraph, OpenAI Agents SDK) · Python/FastAPI · Postgres/Supabase · Next.js/Tailwind · RAG/evals/guardrails

> **TL;DR** – I’m a Madrid‑based AI Engineer & Data Scientist (ex‑IBM) who builds **agentic AI systems** end‑to‑end— from LLM planning/execution and tool orchestration to production APIs and UX. I’m shipping **RAMA Country Living** (real‑estate doc & payments agent) and **FarmersAI** (agri‑paperwork). I care about latency, evals, and shipping clean user experiences.

## About Maria

I design and ship **multi‑agent AI products** that automate documents, ops, and knowledge flows. I’ve led development of conversational logic (multi‑turn, tool‑use, guardrails), built **production‑ready FastAPI services**, and worked directly with stakeholders to align AI with business outcomes. Neuroscience @ UCL; 3+ years building in industry; now focused on **agentic systems** and **full‑stack AI/ML workflows**.

### Main Achievements

- **IBM – Consultant Data Scientist / AI Engineer (2022–2025):** Delivered agentic AI prototypes to production, integrated evals/cost tracking, and supported client teams—helping secure multi‑quarter renewals.
- **RAMA Country Living (2024–present):** Multi‑agent assistant for property docs & payments. Python + FastAPI, OpenAI Agents SDK/LangGraph, Postgres/Supabase, embeddings/RAG. Natural‑language flows to **upload/retrieve/email** documents and trigger backend actions.  
  Repo: `github.com/mariasebarespersona/rama-app`
- **FarmersAI (2025–):** Variant of RAMA for farm compliance & paperwork automation (Spain). Tool‑augmented chat for uploading, classifying, and retrieving docs; roadmap includes payments and CRM sync.
- **Awards/Certs:** IBM Datathlon Winner 2024; AWS Cloud Practitioner; Lloyds ML award.

### Most‑Prideful Builds

| Project | Your role & stack | Impact / Demo |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **RAMA Country Living** | Founder/Engineer • Python + FastAPI • LangGraph + OpenAI Agents SDK • Postgres/Supabase • Next.js/Tailwind | Property owners manage docs/payments via chat; agent executes file ops + emails; production‑grade API surface. |
| **FarmersAI** | Founder/Engineer • Python • Agentic workflows • RAG/evals | Compliance & document automation for farmers; extending RAMA patterns to agri domain. |
| **Banking‑style Agent** | Solo dev • Statements/payments parsing • Reconciliation flows | Automates transaction insights and workflow steps; prototype used for internal demos. |

### Experience (TL;DR)

- **Consultant DS/AI Engineer – IBM** (Nov 2022–Present). Agentic systems, production APIs (FastAPI), client comms; LangGraph, OpenAI Agents SDK, DSPy, embeddings/RAG, evals & token‑cost tracking.  
- **Intern – CFTE** (Aug 2021). Research on FinTech trends (blockchain/AI), content creation.  
- **Side projects/OSS** – RAMA, FarmersAI, banking‑style agent; Next.js/Tailwind UIs.

## How I Work

- **Gets me pumped:** fast shipping, crisp UX for AI, measurable wins (latency ↓, accuracy ↑), teams that write things down.  
- **Disappoints me:** vague goals, over‑engineered pipelines, “demo‑ware” without evals.  
- **Strengths:** agentic orchestration, RAG/evals/guardrails, clean APIs, stakeholder comms.  
- **Improvement points:** ruthless prioritisation; saying “no” earlier to scope creep.  
- **Known behaviours / comms style:** async‑first, structured docs, frequent demos, token‑cost awareness.

## Other

### Some personal stuff
- Spanish/British; based in **Madrid**.  
- Outdoors (hiking/surf/padel), design & front‑end tinkering, community building.  
- Languages: **EN/ES (native), FR (C1)**.

### My vision
- Build and scale **agentic AI assistants** that handle real‑world paperwork and ops (real‑estate, agritech).  
- Join a US‑facing product team or early stage startup where I can ship quickly, own outcomes, and help define the agentic stack.
